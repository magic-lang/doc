# ooc support in text editors

ooc has a varying level of support among different text editors.

Read on to find if your favourite flavor is supported. If you add
support for a new editor, please open an issue on the [ooc-lang.org repo][site-repo].

# vim

ooc support for vim is provided by the [ooc.vim][ooc.vim] plug-in. It provides:

  * Syntax highlighting
  * Indentation support
  * A syntastic plug-in for use with [sam][sam]
  * `:make` command support (launches `rock -v`)

You can read more at the [project repository][ooc.vim]'s page.

# emacs

ooc support for emacs is provided by [ooc-mode][ooc-mode]. It provides:

  * Syntax highlighting
  * Indentation support
  * On the fly syntax check with flymake-ooc

# TextMate

ooc support for TextMate is provided by [ooc.tmbundle][ooc.tmbundle].

# Atom

The [Atom editor][atom] can use converted TextMate bundles.

You can easily convert [ooc.tmbundle][ooc.tmbundle] for your own usage, like so:

    apm init --package ~/.atom/packages/language-ooc --convert https://github.com/nilium/ooc.tmbundle

You might need to restart Atom to see the changes.

# Brackets

The [Brackets editor][brackets] now has an extension for ooc syntax highlighting.
It can be installed from the Extensions Manager by searching for `ooc syntax`.
The source is available [on GitHub][brackets-ooc]

# gtksourceview

gtksourceview-based tools such as gedit, meld, etc. have
ooc support out of the box.

# pygments

[pygments][pygments] has relatively good ooc support built-in. It is a python
solution for syntax highlighting used on GitHub and easy to integrate with
static website generators such as [nanoc][nanoc].
